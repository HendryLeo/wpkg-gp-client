# WPKG-GP - Client
WPKG-GP Client is a small GUI for wpkg-gp that resides in the system tray and informs the user of new updates as well
as allow normal users to upgrade their system through wpkg without a reboot.
It is written in python2.7 and also needs the latest wxpython (not phoenix) as well as pywin32 modules to run/compile.
I will provide precompiled x86 (works on both X64 and X86) binaries so it can be used without any additional software 
installed.

You can find some screenshots (german) in the screenshots folder of the repository. 

I am currently writing a documentation that explains all features and give more detailed installation instructions
