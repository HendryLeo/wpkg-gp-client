WPKG as normal User
-------------------

IDEAS:
- Add Restart Pending also to the automatic timer?
- Add Option to view last log from PopupMenu:
    - (look for last WSH and then beginn of wpkg)
- Add Shutdown Option
    - Add Checkbox to shutdown system after upgrade --> DONE!
    - If error log open this at the next restart?


FIX PYINSTALLER 3.2 until official 3.3 update is available:
pip install https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/archive/develop.zip

Using WPKG-GP:
    http://wpkg-users.wpkg.narkive.com/VOCTlfTt/user-initiated-runs-of-wpkg
%PROGRAMFILES%\wpkg-gp\wpkgpipeclient.exe Execute
this has the sameoutput as when its run on boot, looks like the best solution!

Is there a dryrun option to check for updates?


Options for a special wpkg-gp.ini:
DisableAtBootUp = 1
WpkgExecuteByLocalUsers = 1
WpkgVerbosity = 1 ??? - Check if this alters the output of the Execute command
