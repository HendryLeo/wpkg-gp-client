0.9.7.0:
    - fixed shutdown and reboot functionality if non ASCII characters are used in the translation.
    - implemented another updates checking function through wpkg-gp:
        - wpkg-gp (0.17.12) will query wpkg for pending updates, downgrades, installs and removes.
        - you can selected which method to use (wpkg-gp or updatefile) with the config file
            (updatefile method only checks for updates, but puts less stress on your server as well 
            as work even if no connection to the server is possible)
