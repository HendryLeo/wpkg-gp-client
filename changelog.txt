0.9.7.0:
    - fixed shutdown and reboot functionality if non ASCII characters are used in the translation.
    - implemented update checking function through wpkg-gp:
        - wpkg-gp (0.17.12) will query wpkg for pending updates, downgrades, installs and removes.
        - you can select which method to use (wpkg-gp or updatefile) with the config file
            (updatefile method only checks for updates, but maybe puts less stress on your server as well
            as work even if there is no connection to the server at the time)
        - using wpkg-gp method you can filter what kind of tasks/actions are displayed to the user (config file)
        - using wpkg-gp or updatefile method you can blacklist packages from being displayed to the user (config file)

    But i may remove it soon because it seems to have many problems in other environments.

    TODO STILL:
    Update base translation.pot
    update german translation
    update spanish translation
